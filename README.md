Inspired by the iconic Bauhaus movement, this theme focuses on geometric precision, primary color accents, and functional design. Built with Material 3 principles, it offers a distraction-free writing environment that is both aesthetically pleasing and highly legible.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Minimalistic Design**: A clutter-free interface that prioritizes your content.
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Leverages Material 3 tonal surfaces and geometric shapes.
- **Bauhaus Palette**: Carefully curated red, blue, and yellow accents that pop without being distracting.
- **Geometric Typography**: Optimised for the **Jost** typeface (a modern homage to Futura).
- **High Contrast**: Excellent legibility in both light and dark modes.
- **Pill-Shaped Components**: Modern UI elements for tags and buttons.
- **Clean Layout**: No harsh borders; depth is created through tonal layering.
